### Central park / Ross, Joey and their friends are there

```
I wanna kill myself.
I don't, actually, she left me!
She didn't know, how should I know?
Actually, it's cold.
It's really cold.
```

```
~ 하고 싶어, ~ 하길 원해, ~  
I wanna drink juice.  
I wanna make money.  
I wanna have lunch.  
I wanna work in this office.  
I wanna meet her.  

~ 하고 싶지 않아, 하길 원하지 않아, 하기 싫어
I don't wanna drink water.
I don't wanna make money.
I don't wanna have lunch.
I don't wanna work in this office.
I don't wanna meet her.
```
