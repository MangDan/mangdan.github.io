### Monica's room / Joey and Chandler are sitting around the table.

```
Rach : Isn't this amazing? I mean, I've never made cof-fee before in my life.

Chan : I'm not saying this as a joke. That is amazing!

Joey : Congratulations!

Rach : Y'know, I figure if I can make coffe, there isn't anything I can't do.

Joey : Listen, if you feel like, would you make me a Western omelet or something?
Although, actually I'm really no that hungry.
