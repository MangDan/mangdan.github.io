### Central park / Ross, Joey and their friends are there

```
I told my parents last night
They seemed to take it pretty well
OK Ross, look.
Can I tell you what the answer is?
I want you to join us.
I don't wanna be single, okay?
I just wanna be married again!
And I just wanna be a millionaire!
```

```
