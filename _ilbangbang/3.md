### Central park / Ross, Joey and their friends are there
Rachel?

```
Oh, Monica, Thank God!

Everybody, This is Rachel.
Rachel, This is everybody!

Hi!

So you wanna tell us now? or are we waiting (웨이링) for your wedding?

Oh God, well, do you want me to tell the truth?
Before the wedding, I started (스타릿) wondering 'Why am I doing this, (왜 하고 있지?)
and who am I doing this for?' (누구를 위해서?)
So... anyway I just didn't know where to go, 
and I know that you're the only person who lived here in the city.

Who wasn't invited to the wedding?

Ooh, I wan kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue.
```

kind of (=kinda), sort of (=sorta)
직접적으로 표현하기 힘들때 (그저 좀...)

```
내가 ~했으면 좋겠니?,  너 내가 ~ 하길 원하니?, 내가 ~ 해줄까?
Do you want me to stay with you?
Do you want me to pay for you?
Do you want me to find my job?
Do you want me to carry this carrier?
Do you want me to call him instead of you?
```
