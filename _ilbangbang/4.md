### Monica's room / Rachel is calling her father in the room.

```
Daddy, I'm serious. (정말이에요, 농담 아니에요)

C'mon Daddy, listen to me! 
It's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me.
'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, You're a shoe!'
And today I just stopped (스탑, ed 발음은 보통 생략) and I said, 
'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? 
What if I wanna be a purse, you know? Or a hat!'
No, I'm not saying (~라는게 아니에요, ~라고 말하는게 아니에요)
I want a hat, I just wanted to say a metaphor.
It's a metaphor, Daddy!
````

I'm serious. (정말이에요, 농담 아니에요)
* I'm not joking / I'm not kidding / It's no joke)
* I'm sorry, but I can't marry him! I just don't love (저슷 돈) him.

No, I'm not saying (~라는게 아니에요, ~라고 말하는게 아니에요)

```
나는 단지 ~하려고 했어, 단지 ~ 하고 싶었어
I just wanted to give her a ride.
I just wanted to tell the truth.
I just wanted to teach her.
I just wanted to say hello.
I just wanted to cancel my schedule.
I just wanted to drink beer with my friend.
I just wanted to clean my desk.
