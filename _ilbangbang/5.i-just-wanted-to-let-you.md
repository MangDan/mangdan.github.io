### Monica's room / Rachel, Monica, Phoebe and their friends are in the room
```
Just breathe, breathe, Just try to think of nice things...

Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens~

I'm all better now.

Okay, don't worry, you know? Independence!
The whole 'hat' thing!

And! you can always come to joey.
I live across the hall.

Joey, stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day!

What? I just wanted to let her know!
````

Raindrops on roses 장미꽃 위에 가랑비
kittens 새끼 고양이

I'm all (완전히) better now.
완전 좋아

across the hall 복도 건너편

stop hitting on ~ ~를 귀찮게 하지마

Don't worry
* stop worrying / No need to worry / Take it easy

```
난 단지 너를 ~하게 하고 싶었을 뿐이야, 난 그냥 너를 ~해주고 싶어.
I just wanted to let you know.
I just wanted to let you go.
I just wanted to let you work.
I just wanted to let you meet her.
I just wanted to let you have lunch.
I just wanted to let you comfort (relax).
I just wanted to let you feel fun.
