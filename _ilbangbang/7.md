### Monica's room / Ross and Rachel are in the room.

```
So Rachel, What're you up to tonight?

Well, I was kinda supposed to be in Aruba on my honeymoon...., so nothing!

Aruba? this time of year, big lizards.
Anyway if you're free, could you help me?

Help you? What do you want me to do for you?

Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together  my new furniture.

Well actually, I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.
It's been (=has been) kinda a long day.

Okay, sure.
